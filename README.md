# Brief description / purpose
A fast food restaurant,OZJ Restaurant needs to efficiently bill customers and keep records of the
different types of foods used up.

I have been hired to develop a simple Fast Food Order & Billing System that
will enable the restaurant to bill their customers quickly, and at the end of the day
produce a Daily Sales Report.

The restaurant sells 4 types of Combo meals consisting of different combinations of
food products with prices as shown in the table below:

| COMBO |                  Food Description                 | Price (RM) |
|:-----:|:-------------------------------------------------:|:----------:|
|   A   |      2pc Fried Chicken + Coke + French Fries      |    10.00   |
|   B   |     Chicken/Beer Burger + Coke + French Fries     |    15.00   |
|   C   |     Double Cheese Burger + Coke + French Fries    |    18.00   |
|   D   | Spaghetti with Chicken Chop + Coke + French Fries |    24.00   |

For example, a customer who orders 3 sets of Combo C will be charged 3 x RM 18.00 = RM 54.00. 
He will also need to pay an extra 10% for SST (Sales / Service Tax).
So the total he need to pay is RM 59.40.

After the last customer for the day, a Daily Sales Report will be produced, showing the summary of the sales for that day.
